## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm a PhD student at Georgia Tech and a visiting student at UIUC. 

My research interests lie in Multi-Modal Learning, Generative Models (including Multimodal LLMs and Diffusion Models) and Video Understanding. More details can be found in my [homepage](https://bolinlai.github.io/).

Please drop me an email if you have questions about my work or have interests in collaboration!
